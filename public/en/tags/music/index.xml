      <description>Welcome to Radio Project Today I want to start a series of posts in which we will learn together the steps to follow when creating an online radio station.

But one day I found ZenoRadio (NO ADVERTISING, it really is a good platform), a modern alternative and with a very generous free plan.</description>
