# Welcome to Radio Project

Today I want to start a series of posts in which we will learn together the steps to follow when creating an online radio station. At first, when I started this project I found several platforms that offered this service for free, but the vast majority of pages were paid and others had aged quite badly. But one day I found [**ZenoRadio**](https://zeno.fm) (NO ADVERTISING, it really is a good platform), a modern alternative and with a very generous free plan.

# Why create an online radio station?

There are several reasons why someone might want to create an online radio station, some of them would be:

1.  **Flexibility**: An online radio station offers more flexibility than a traditional radio station. You can broadcast from anywhere, anytime, and reach a global audience.
    
2.  **Low cost**: Creating an online radio station is cheaper than creating a traditional radio station. No expensive equipment is needed and there is no need to rent or buy physical space for the station.
    
3.  **Broader audience**: An online radio station has the potential to reach a global audience. People can tune into the station from anywhere in the world, which means that new listeners can be reached from all over the world.
    
4.  **Interactivity**: An online radio station can allow for greater interaction with listeners. Listeners can send messages to the station, request songs, and enter sweepstakes or contests.
    
5.  **Innovation**: An online radio station can be more innovative than a traditional radio station. You can use tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance the user experience and customize programming for each listener.
    

# Creating our first station on ZenoRadio

Clearly the first step is to enter [ZenoRadio](https://zeno.fm) and create an account, either with Gmail or another email, it is super simple so I will assume that you already have an account. Once we have verified our account and entered our personal information, we will find, on the left side, the **Stations** option, where we can create our stations.

Click on the **Add Station** button. Fill in the requested fields; name, logo, type of content, etc., and finally press **Create**.Now we can finish configuring our station, adding more information about it, adding links to our social networks and much more. Once this is done we go to the **Tools** > **Auto DJ** tab to upload our audio tracks that will be played automatically, with the free version *ZenoRadio* allows us to add up to 200 audio tracks, but if we decide to pay the *Prime* plan we will have up to 1000 tracks.

Once you have uploaded some tracks, a *playlist* will be created which you can organize as you like; on the left side of the three buttons you can drag the tracks up or down to change the playback order. To finish, we go again to **Settings**, we go down a little bit to the *Server* part and in *Server Status* we click to start the transmission.

And that's it, we would have our online radio transmitting.If we want to check that everything went well, we go again to **Tools** and copy the link that appears in the part of *Page Settings* (in this same part we can edit this link), we paste it in the browser bar and it should load our station.

In a next post we will see how to connect to our radio, to transmit from external applications such as **Mixxx**, **VirtualDJ** or **MPD**, we will also see how to obtain the **.m3u** link that will allow us to listen to our station from **VLC** or any other player that supports **m3u**.
